# tortoise

**NOTE: not production ready**

Tortoise, it's an animal living in the Kubernetes cluster.

Tortoise, you need to feed only very few parameters to them.

Tortoise, it'll soon start to eat historical usage data of Pods.

Tortoise, it likes changing HPA, VPA, and Pods resource request/limit based on historical usage data.

Tortoise, once you start to live with them, you no longer need to configure HPA, VPA, Pod's resource request/limit by yourself.

Tortoise, now you know, it's not only cute but also everything you need to manage your Kubernetes resources with minimum effort.

## Install

Tortoise, you cannot get it from the breeder.

Tortoise, you need to get it from GitHub instead.

```shell
# install all needed resources to the cluster.
make install
```

Tortoise, you don't need a rearing cage, but need VPA in your Kubernetes cluster before installing it.
